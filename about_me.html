                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I am a second-year mechanical engineering student with a strong focus on maintaining high academic performance while actively exploring my interests outside the classroom. Fitness and weightlifting play a big role in my life, as I enjoy pushing myself to achieve new personal bests. I am also passionate about rocketry and propulsion, and I recently joined the UASTARR club to gain hands-on experience and eventually contribute to its liquid-fueled propulsion project. Over the past year, Iâ€™ve developed an interest in coding and web development, building projects such as this CV website while learning Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub. I enjoy combining problem-solving with practical projects and take pride in continually improving both academically and personally.</p>

                    <h1>Fitness</h1>
                    <P>I really enjoy going to the gym, and weightlifting is my main focus. I like pushing myself to hit new personal bests and seeing steady progress over time. Training has taught me dedication and consistency, and I find the challenge of improving my strength both fun and motivating.</P>

                    <h1>Rockets</h1>
                    <p>I have a strong interest in rocketry and propulsion systems, and I recently joined the UASTARR club at my university to further develop my knowledge in this area. I am joining with the intent to eventually help contribute to the design of the new liquid-fueled propulsion system. This will give me the chance to apply my engineering studies to a real project while learning from hands-on experience and teamwork.</p>

                    <h1>Coding</h1>
                    <p>After completing a programming course in my first year of university, I began developing my skills further through the Odin Project, where I am nearing the end of the fundamentals portion. I have gained experience with GitHub, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy applying these skills to practical projects. Currently, I am building a CV website for one of my classes as well as a hub to showcase future web projects.</p>
