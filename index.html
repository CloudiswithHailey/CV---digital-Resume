      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Motivated Mechanical Engineering Co-op student at the University of Alberta with hands-on experience in physically demanding and detail-oriented roles. Through 10-hour shifts as a Concrete Labourer, I developed resilience, reliability, and technical precision while following strict safety protocols. As a Line Cook, I thrived in a fast-paced environment, building strong teamwork and leadership skills by mentoring new staff. My merchandising experience further strengthened my ability to read and apply technical diagrams with accuracy while coordinating effectively with teams. Combined with coursework in Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, and Materials Science, these experiences demonstrate my capacity to adapt quickly, work collaboratively, and contribute effectively to engineering projects both in the field and in the workplace.

          <h3>Fitness</h3>
          <p>I really enjoy going to the gym, and weightlifting is my main focus. I like pushing myself to hit new personal bests and seeing steady progress over time. Training has taught me dedication and consistency, and I find the challenge of improving my strength both fun and motivating.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Rockets</h3>
          <p>I have a strong interest in rocketry and propulsion systems, and I recently joined the UASTARR club at my university to further develop my knowledge in this area. I am joining with the intent to eventually help contribute to the design of the new liquid-fueled propulsion system. This will give me the chance to apply my engineering studies to a real project while learning from hands-on experience and teamwork.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>After completing a programming course in my first year of university, I began developing my skills further through the Odin Project, where I am nearing the end of the fundamentals portion. I have gained experience with GitHub, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy applying these skills to practical projects. Currently, I am building a CV website for one of my classes as well as a hub to showcase future web projects.</p>
